1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,710
All righty.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,680
So in this video, I'm going to show you one method for creating your very own custom animated loading

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,280
icon.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,510
This Web site is called Loading Dock IO.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,260
I'll provide a link within the course.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,320
And they have a very easy to use interface where you can adjust a number of different settings and output

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,850
in a number of different formats.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,210
You can see if we scroll down, they have a few paid options here, but that they have plenty of free

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,590
options as well.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,720
This is a great opportunity to add your own personal style to any project.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,150
I'm going to show you something basic, but I encourage you to take some time and experiment.

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,460
I'm going to start by changing the bass icon.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,610
So instead of this, I actually prefer this cube here.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,500
So I'm going to click on this.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
And then you can see that it's changed in our settings here.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,650
And the first cool thing about this is we have the option of actually using theme's for our colors.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,680
So you can see we have the Lion King, Frozen Dragon Ball and even stuff like 7-Eleven or Netflix.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,450
So you can actually add a custom color theme that matches a certain brand.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,990
If you want.

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,920
Which is pretty cool.

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,690
I'm going to keep it simple and I'm just going to manually add colors.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,190
I want black for the main squares and I will use red for the accent here.

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,530
So if I click on it, it opens up a color selector, I'm going to switch that to black.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,490
And then for this, I'm just going to switch this to like.

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,270
A dark red.

26
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,720
Something like that.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,830
Something close to that.

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,010
Yeah, that's pretty good.

29
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,140
OK, and you can see that we have some other options here.

30
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,090
And for me personally, I'm only going to change one other option, and that is the size.

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,920
So instead of it being two hundred pixels, I'm going to make it 100 pixels.

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,340
The sliding bar is a nice touch.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,010
You can see that I'm dramatically zooming in and out.

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,620
But if you want to be more precise, you can actually click on the pencil icon and just enter in the

35
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,370
size you want.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,820
So I want 100.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,530
Exactly.

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,330
And then I'm going to press enter.

39
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,030
And that's great.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,930
I'm done with that.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,930
So I'm done customizing this.

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,300
I actually do want it to be transparent as well.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,140
That's important.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,470
And now I'm going to actually download this.

45
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,510
So in this case, I'm going to download it as an animated as the chief.

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,550
So if you're not familiar with SVOD, they stand for a scalable vector graphics.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,110
It uses coordinates in 2D space to create lines and shapes.

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,090
The image you are seeing is actually made of code, unlike a traditional image file.

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,930
The main benefits are that the file sizes are smaller and you can make an SPG any size.

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,580
And it would look just as sharp.

51
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,060
Whereas if you zoom in on an image, the more you zoom in, the lower the quality gets.

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,160
OK.

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,490
I'm going to click animated here and I'm gonna be prompted to log in.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,340
So it's totally free, but you're going to need to log in with your email or you can sign up.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,010
So I'm going to do that.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:25,110
Okay, so now that I'm logged in, I'm going to click SPG animated again and I'm going to go over here

57
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,250
to free download.

58
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,560
And you can see that we have our file here.

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,690
You can see it's transparent, which is perfect.

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,640
And I'm going to download it.

61
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,210
And you can see we have a file here and I'm just going to copy that over to my desktop.

62
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,470
OK, so you can see we have our file on our desktop here.

63
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm going to just rename it to be Loader Dartez Viji.

64
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,460
And the first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna open it with Visual Studio Code.

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,170
So we can see here that it is just code.

66
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,560
This is the entirety of our loading animation.

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,340
Each of these rectangles is one of the rectangles within the cube.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,400
You can see it has a y axis and has an x axis and it has a width and a height and a full color as well.

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,850
If you wanted to actually customize even further, you could change the colors in the code and use it

70
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,390
that way.

71
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:26,770
And in terms of actually putting this into your project, you could actually just copy this code wherever

72
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,940
you want in your project.

73
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:35,650
But the other option you have is actually just using an image element and setting this as the source.

74
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,560
So that's something we're going to do in the next video when we integrate this loader into our project.

75
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,700
All right.

76
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,030
So I'll see you in the next one where we start setting up our project.

77
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,160
Bye for now.
